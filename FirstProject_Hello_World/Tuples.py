  # Turples are like lists, you use them to store a sequence of objects, but you can't change them when u create them

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # This is a list because we use square brackets []
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)  # This is a tuple because we are using parenthesis ()
numbers[0] = 10 # If you try to reassign the value of an element from a turple it will give an error
