# The issue in your code lies in the way you are handling the time.sleep function when encountering
# a space character. Even though you are calling time.sleep(0), it doesn't effectively skip the delay
# since time.sleep(0) still results in a very brief pause. To truly skip the delay for spaces, you should
# restructure your loop to conditionally apply the delay only for non-space characters.
